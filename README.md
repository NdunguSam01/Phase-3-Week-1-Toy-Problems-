# IP01 Wk1 Code Challenge
## Description

This project is aimed at solving three problems:

1. Converting a 12-hour time to 24-hour time e.g converting 8:30 am to 0830 hrs
2. Checking if exactly two out three integers passed into a function are positive numbers and returning True e.g.passing (2, 4, -3) into the function returns True
3. Returning the highest value of consonant substrings e.g. 
    For example, for the word "zodiacs", let's cross out the vowels. We get: "z d cs"
    The consonant substrings are: "z", "d" and "cs" and the values are z = 26, d = 4 and cs = 3 + 19 = 22. The highest is 26.

## How to Run

Follow these instructions to run the Python files in this project.

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. 
You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/NdunguSam01/Phase-3-Week-1-Toy-Problems-.git
   ```
3. **Navigating to the project directory**

   Type the following command in your terminal
   ```bash
   cd Phase-3-Week-1-Toy-Problems
   ```
   cd your-project

4. **Running the projet files**

Since this project has three files, you can run the files individually by typing the following commands on the terminal:

```
python3 Time-Formatter.py
```

```
python3 Positive-Integer.py
```

```
python3 Consonant-Value.py
```

5. **Expected Results**

Once each file is executed, you should be able to see the results on the terminal
